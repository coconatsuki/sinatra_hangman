# Sinatra hangman

This is a project from the online bootcamp 'Odin Project' :

This is a mix of 2 exercise. The first one was to make an easy 'hangman' application :

The second exercise was to try SINATRA (as an introduction to learn how to use Rails) and adapt the previous code to it :

The first time for me to use SINATRA was when adapting the CAESAR CODE application to it.

For the Hangman, I had to manage it all by myself with less instructions,
and I also had fun making images for each step of the game.

I really liked the possibility of sharing the game with my friends and family !
I remembered being really excited at that time.
(With the game on command line only, it wasn't really accessible).
